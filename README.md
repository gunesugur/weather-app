**Weather App**
* I made a weather application with the weather APIs I pulled from the OpenWeather site.
* While making this application, I pulled two different APIs from the openWeather site.
* The first of these is weather data, which keeps up-to-date data.
* The second is hourly weather forecast data.
* By writing the application with React and pure css, I aimed to develop myself further in the field of css and react.
* The openWeather site is attached (https://openweathermap.org/)
